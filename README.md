This is a codecademy project with a real world application. The challenge was to use the Luhn algorithm to determine if credit card numbers are valid. 
* The arrays with the card numbs are the only things that were complete.
* The function validateCred was created by me to iterate through any CC array using trh Luhn method.
* More about the Luhn algorithm: [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description)
