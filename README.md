This is a codecademy project with a real world application. The challenge was to use the Luhn algorithm to determine if credit card numbers are valid. 
* The arrays with the card numbs are the only things that were complete.
* The function validateCred was created by me to iterate through any CC array using the Luhn method.
* The function invalidCC iterates through the batch array to return all invalid cards
* The function idInvalidCardCompanies iterates through the invalidCC array to return the issuer of the invalid card
* I have added an HTML file that allows users to type in a 15 or 16 digit credit card number to be validated.
* The submit.onclick function grabs the data from the text box and pushes the array to the validateCred function.
